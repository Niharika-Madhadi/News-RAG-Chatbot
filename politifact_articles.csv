RFK Jr. said a government arm is spraying the sky with jet fuel chemicals. That’s Pants on Fire!,Madison Czopek,"May 5, 2025","During a town hall hosted by TV personality Phil McGraw, known as Dr. Phil, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that one of the Defense Department’s research and development arms might be spraying Americans with harmful chemicals.
An audience member who identified herself as Emily prompted Kennedy’s comments.
""My biggest concern is the stratospheric aerosol injections that are continuously peppered on us every day,"" shesaid. ""Bromium, aluminum, strontium — it’s sprayed in our skies all day long.""
When McGraw asked Emily if she had a specific question, she said, ""Yes, how do we stop it?""
Kennedy responded. ""That is not happening in my agency. We don’t do that. It’s done, we think, by DARPA,"" he said, referring to the Defense Department’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. ""And a lot of it now is coming out of the jet fuel. You know, those materials are put in jet fuel. I’m going to do everything in my power to stop it.""

Kennedy’s statement builds on years of chemtrail conspiracy theories, which allege that theU.S. governmentisspraying toxic chemicalsfrom airplanes. PolitiFact has repeatedly reported thatchemtrailsaren’t real.
We examined jet fuel’s components to check Kennedy’s version of the claim. DARPA did not respond to our request for comment. Although Kennedy’s office responded to PolitiFact, it provided no evidence for his statement.
Planes aren’t spraying jet fuel as part of a Defense Department program when flying. The clouds seen behind airplanes when they fly arecalled contrails, short for condensation trails, and they’re primarilyice crystals, not jet fuel. Jet fuel is primarily made of mixtures of hydrogen and carbon compounds, with small amounts of impurities. Rarely, planes will dump jet fuel at high altitudes or in remote areas during emergency situations. For example, there were, on average, roughly 15 fuel dumps per year from fiscal 2015 to 2020 out of about 25.5 million flights per year, the Federal Aviation Administrationreported.
The town hall questioner referenced ""stratospheric aerosol injections,"" which refers to the concept ofreleasing morereflective aerosol particles into the stratosphere that would reflect sunlight in an attempt to cool the planet.
Experts on atmospheric science who are familiar with this idea told PolitiFact they weren’t aware of any current initiatives ""peppering"" the skies with such injections. Scientists have explored models and researched it in labs, but the work isn’t being done in the atmosphere, they said.
""There is no publicly available information supporting the idea that any entity is deliberately releasing materials in the stratosphere at scale, with the exception of the relatively small amounts that come from rocket exhaust,"" said Chris Field, a Stanford University interdisciplinary environmental studies professor.
Experts also said they didn’t know of proposals to use materials such as aluminum or strontium that the town hall attendee singled out. Faye McNeill, a Columbia University professor of chemical engineering and earth and environmental sciences, said materials for such injections would have to be abundant, inexpensive and have minimal environmental and human health impacts. The most commonly discussed materials are sulfate and calcium carbonate, she said, not the chemicals mentioned in the town hall.
Kennedy linked the chemicals the town hall attendee mentioned — including aluminum and strontium — to jet fuel. The attendee also mentioned ""bromium,"" which is not a chemical element. Barium and bromine are chemical elements.
None of those elements are in jet fuel.
Jet fuel consists of hydrocarbons with ""trace amounts"" of other additives, said Joshua Heyne, director of the Washington State University Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Laboratory.
Heyne said elements such as aluminum, strontium, bromine or barium would be unwanted and potentially dangerous contaminants to the fuel system, so if they were present in jet fuel ""they would be at very low concentrations, likely undetectable by most analytical methods.""
The Environmental Protection Agency said ina 2000 fact sheetthat it still refers to on itswebsitethat aircraft jet fuel is ""analyzed for strict impurity limits before use.""
Kennedy said DARPA is spraying the skies with chemicals that are in jet fuel. That builds off the widely debunked chemtrails conspiracy theory and Kennedy provided no evidence to support the statement. We rate it Pants on Fire!

"Will President Donald Trump’s tariffs cost families $4,000, as Chuck Schumer says?",Louis Jacobson,"May 5, 2025","President Donald Trump’s broad array of tariffs on foreign goods hasspookedconsumers, businesses and the stock market. But what will the specific impact be for typical American consumers?
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., offered a figure April 27 on CNN’s ""State of the Union.""
Schumer said as a candidate, Trump never fully explained to voters that tariffs would raise their costs. ""It's estimated it'll raise the American costs. … American families would have to pay about $4,000 more a year,"" Schumer said.
Calculating how typical households would be hit involves estimation and assumptions — especially given Trump’s frequent tinkering with what items will be tariffed and when. But Schumer’s figure is roughly in line with four independent estimates that PolitiFact identified.
Four of five estimates by groups with varying political ideologies range from $3,100 to $4,900 a year; the midpoint of that range is in line with Schumer’s figure. A fifth group estimated the cost to consumers would be $1,243.
The estimates’ variations stem from the group’s differing assumptions about how the tariffs will be absorbed into the economy.
Schumer’s office did not respond to inquiries for this article.
We identified five estimates on Trump’s tariffs effect on American families, based on the tariffs he imposed before April 2 (including those on Canada and Mexico), the 10% across-the-board tariffs on virtually every country, and the 145% tariff on China. The estimates do not include the impact of higher country-by-country tariffs that Trump announced April 2 but paused for 90 days beginning on April 9.
Here are the estimates in descending order.
Yale Budget Lab.Themost recent estimatefrom the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University shows an average loss per household of $4,900. The lab also offered a more limited calculation that accounts for changes in consumer behavior because of tariffs without factoring those in as losses; this worked out to a $2,600 loss per family.
The analysis found that low-earning families would be hit hardest: A family earning roughly $30,000 to $40,000, would lose 5.1% of its income, more than twice the proportional hit for a family earning well above $100,000.

Center for American Progress.The Center for American Progress, a liberal group,estimatedan average loss of $4,600 annually.
American Action Forum.The American Action Forum, a center-right think tank, told PolitiFact that its pre-April 9 estimate of $3,900 loss per household remains a solid guess even though it was calculated using a 60% tariff on China, rather than the current 145%. Jacob Jensen, the group’s trade policy analyst, said tariffs as high as 145% curb consumer purchases so much that they tend to bring in less revenue than tariffs that are set with lower rates.
Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.The nonpartisan Tax Policy Centerestimatedthat the average household loss would be $3,100.
Tax Foundation.The center-right Tax Foundation put the average loss lower than the other four: $1,243.
Erica York, the Tax Foundation’s vice president of federal tax policy, told PolitiFact that her group’s analysis has a more limited scope, encompassing households’ 2025 direct losses of income from higher taxes.
York said other groups’ estimates go beyond this, including loss in quality of life from having to switch to inferior products, factoring in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy response or using 2026 — assuming that it produces a full year of impact — rather than 2025, when the tariffs will be in force for less than a full year.
Differing methods such as these would produce variations in numbers, she said, citing the Yale Budget lab’s dual estimates as an example.
Schumer said ""it's estimated"" that Trump’s tariffs will mean ""American families would have to pay about $4,000 more a year.""
Calculating tariffs’ impact requires guesswork, and is complicated by Trump’s frequent pauses on certain tariffs.
Four independent groups’ estimates range from $3,100 a year to $4,900 a year on average. The fifth, using a more restrictive method, estimated a $1,243 loss.
Based on these estimates, the statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/may/05/charles-schumer/trump-tariffs-cost-average-family-schumer/

"Trump-era fentanyl seizures have not saved up to 258 million lives, as Pam Bondi said. Here's why.",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"May 1, 2025","President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office fell on the same day as National Fentanyl Awareness Day. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi marked the milestone by crediting Trump with saving a third of the U.S. population from fatal fentanyl overdoses.
Fentanyl isa potent synthetic opioidthat causes themajority of opioid overdosesin the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine. Its potency is what makes it so lethal.
""Today is Fentanyl Awareness Day. In President Trump’s first 100 days we’ve seized over 22 million fentanyl laced pills, saving over 119 Million lives,"" Bondi said April 29 onX. That’s about one-third of theU.S. population.
Bondi shared a clip from Fox News that included 2025 Drug Enforcement Administration fentanyl seizure data. As of April 28, the agency hadseized22.2 million fentanyl pills and 3,100 pounds of powdered fentanyl in 2025. The seizures ""represent over 119 million deadly doses,"" the DEA website says, calculating 2 milligrams of fentanyl as a ""potentially deadly dose.""
At an April 30 Cabinet meeting, Bondi made a similar statement with larger numbers, crediting Trump with saving 75% of the U.S. population from fentanyl overdoses.
""Since you have been in office President Trump, your DOJ agencies have seized more than 22 million fentanyl pills, 3,400 kilos of fentanyl, since your last hundred days,"" Bondisaid. ""Which saved —  are you ready for this, media? — 258 million lives.""
It’s unclear how Bondi reached those figures about fentanyl seized or lives saved. The 3,100 pounds the DEA said it seized equates to 1,400 kilograms. The Department of Justice did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. A department spokesperson toldSlatethat the 258 million estimate included FBI fentanyl seizures.
Drug policy experts say Bondi’s statements are an exaggeration premised on a distorted understanding of seizure data.
""Bondi’s statements demonstrate profound ignorance about fentanyl and interdiction,"" Dr. Ryan Marino, a Case Western Reserve University toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction, said.
Bondi failed to account for the limitations in fentanyl seizure data, the caveats about fentanyl’s lethality and the fact that not everyone has the same chance of dying of a fentanyl overdose.
Also, Bondi’s statement assumes everyone in the U.S. planned to consume fentanyl.
""119 million Americans do not even use fentanyl, and to risk an overdose requires intentional ingestion of fentanyl (or another illicit drug contaminated with fentanyl),"" Marino said. ""Fentanyl overdose is not a risk for people who do not use drugs, as you cannot experience an overdose from touch, inhalation, or proximity to fentanyl.""
CDC data shows that about 11% of people age 12 and older use illegal drugs.
Andrew Stolbach, a toxicologist and emergency doctor at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, toldPolitiFactin 2023 that using fentanyl seizure data to make broad characterizations about how many people could have died or been saved ""assume that all that drug was somehow going to get into everybody.""
There’s likely enough water to drown everybody in the world. But that doesn’t mean everyone is going to drown, he said.

Containers of fentanyl pills are displayed at a Drug Enforcement Administration research laboratory, April 29, 2025, in Northern Virginia. (AP)
Bondi’s numbers don’t make mathematical or logical sense.
Her X statement that seizing 22 million pills saved 119 million lives assumes that one pill would be shared by five people — and each of those people then die of an overdose. Drug experts say that’s unlikely.
""It does not make sense to say that seizing one pill saved five lives,"" Jonathan Caulkins, a Carnegie Mellon University drug policy researcher, said. ""Usually a pill is only consumed by one person. It would be an odd situation for a single pill to kill five people.""
Additionally, not every pill consumption leads to death. The DEAsaysthat as little as 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be deadly for an adult. However, a dose’s lethality can vary based on a person's height, weight and tolerance from past exposure, drug experts say. The 2 milligrams lethal dose generally refers to people who have not previously consumed fentanyl.
""Usually when a pill is consumed, no one dies,"" Caulkins said. ""There are high-frequency users consuming multiple pills per day for multiple years before they succumb, if ever, to an overdose.""
Also the 2 milligrams refers to pure fentanyl. It’s generallyunclearhow much pure fentanyl is in the pills or pounds of powdered fentanyl that are seized, Marino said. Therefore, that the DEA seized 119 million lethal doses does not mean the Trump administration saved 119 million people.
Politicians have framed drug seizure data in positive or negative terms depending on their political aim.
For example, the Homeland Security Department said in an April 28press releasethat U.S. Customs and Border Protection had seized 64,000 pounds of fentanyl during former President Joe Biden’s administration. ""Enough fentanyl to kill 14 billion people.""
However, using Bondi’s logic, DHS could have also said that Biden saved 14 billion lives, double the world’s population. Either way, the fact-check caveats we already discussed apply.
Some politicians cite rises in drug seizures as a sign ofimproved interdiction. Others say those same numbers are evidence thatmore drugsare getting into the country. But drug experts say it’s hard to tell who’s right given insufficient data.
""We don’t have any method I’m aware of for translating drug seizure data into any measure of overdose deaths averted,"" Alene Kennedy-Hendricks, a Johns Hopkins University health policy expert, said.
To know how much fentanyl is in the U.S., experts said we need to know how much fentanyl is being produced, how much is being sent to the U.S. and how much is seized. We only have data on how much fentanyl is seized.
That’s part of what makes Bondi’s statement wrong. That the DEA seized 22 million pills does not mean that it reduced 22 million people’s consumption of fentanyl pills, Caulkins said.
""When drugs are seized, the supply chain partially replaces those lost drugs,"" Caulkins said.
David Luckey, a senior international and defense researcher at Rand Corp., a global policy think tank, said that the lack of data about illicit fentanyl leads to statements that are ""estimates at best, and a misuse of the data at worse.""

Fentanylseizureshave generally risen over the past decade. But they dropped in fiscal year 2024 to less than 22,000 pounds at U.S. borders compared with 27,000 in fiscal 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures show. Fiscal years start in October and end in September.
In the first two full months of the Trump administration, fentanyl seizures dropped compared to the last full month of Biden’s administration. In December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 1,200 pounds of fentanyl at U.S. borders. That dropped to 611 pounds and 760 pounds in February and March, respectively.
Fentanyl overdose deaths also started dropping during the Biden administration. The CDCreported50,000 fentanyl overdose deaths from December 2023 to November 2024, the latest available data. That’s a drop from more than 75,000 in the previous similar period.
It’sunclearwhether the drop in overdose deaths will last and for how long.
Drug expertssaythat to reduce fentanyl overdose deaths, the focus can’t be only on drug seizures. Reducing the demand for fentanyl and expanding access to treatments, such as the opioid overdose reversal drug Narcan, also play a role.
Bondi said ""in President Trump’s first 100 days we’ve seized over 22 million fentanyl laced pills, saving over 119 Million lives."" A day later, she upped the number of saved lives to 258 million.
Neither figure is accurate.
The DEA said it has seized 119 million deadly fentanyl doses in 2025. Crediting that seizure with saving up to 75% of the U.S. population makes no mathematical sense.
Bondi’s calculation rests on the assumption that 2 milligrams of fentanyl is lethal. However, lethality varies based on a person’s height, weight and tolerance to the drug. It also assumes that all fentanyl seized is pure fentanyl, which is generally not the case.
Additionally, the number of people who die from opioid overdoses each year is in the tens of thousands. Drug experts say 119 million people in the U.S. do not consume fentanyl or illicit drugs that may be laced with fentanyl; people who do not consume illicit drugs are not at risk of dying of an overdose.

President Donald Trump says Kilmar Abrego Garcia has “‘MS-13’ on his knuckles.” Pants on Fire!,Louis Jacobson,"April 30, 2025","President Donald Trump repeatedly clashed with ABC News’ Terry Moran about whether Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia — whom the U.S. government deported to El Salvador in March despite an order not to deport him there — had MS13, representing the MS-13 gang, tattooed on his knuckles.
During the ABC News interview that aired April 29, Trump referred to an image heshared on Truth Socialon April 18 showing what he said was Abrego Garcia’s tattoos.
The image shows a left hand with four tattoos, one on each finger — a marijuana leaf, a smiley face with the letter X for eyes, a cross and a skull.
The hand also displays an M, an S, a 1 and a 3 in a printed font above these tattoos. The words describing the pictorial tattoos also appear below each one in a small, printed typeface.
Trump told Moran that Abrego Garcia’s hand says MS13, which Moran said was disputed and that some had said the tattoos were ""interpreted that way."" Trump said, ""Don't do that — M, S, one, three — it says M, S, one, three."" Moran countered, ""That was Photoshopped.""
Moran tried to move on, but Trump continued. ""Terry, do you want me to show you the picture?"" Trump said. ""He had ‘M,’ ‘S’ as clear as you can be. Not ‘interpreted.’""
After Moran again tried to shift to a question about Ukraine, Trump said that Abrego Garcia has ""got ‘MS-13’ on his knuckles.""
Trump’s ABC News interview goes far beyond the impression he left when heshared an image on Truth Socialof what he said were Abrego Garcia’s finger tattoos. Trump insisted in the ABC News interview that ""MS-13"" appears on Abrego Garcia’s hand as a clear sign of gang affiliation, which was part of the evidence used to deport him.
When we asked the White House for comment, a spokesperson said that any law enforcement or immigration official with on-the-ground experience could link Abrego Garcia’s tattoos to theMS-13 gang.
The figures M, S, 1 and 3 and the words below the symbols don’t appear in other recent photographs of Abrego Garcia’s hand, including one that Salvadoran government officials took when Abrego Garcia met with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., on April 17. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukelesharedit on X.

The tattoos also do not appear in afamily photoof Abrego Garcia shared by immigration advocates.
MS-13 experts told PolitiFact thatnone of the pictorial tattoos in the photographis a known signifier of MS-13.
The Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia on March 15 to CECOT, a Salvadoranmega-prisonwhere Trump has sent hundreds of Salvadoran and Venezuelan men who were previously in the U.S. But Abrego Garcia had a protection order that was supposed to prevent him from being deported to El Salvador. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lawyersacknowledgedthat they were aware of the restriction and in court filings called his removal an ""oversight"" and ""an administrative error.""
The Trump administration has said that Abrego Garcia and others deported to El Salvador wereMS-13 gang members, which Abrego Garcia and attorneys have denied in court filings. All of the men were deported without due process; the government didn’t present evidence of their gang membership before a judge in the deportation case and the migrants weren’t given the opportunity to defend themselves. The New York Timesreportedmost of the 238 men deported to El Salvador have neither criminal records in the U.S. nor documented links to a Venezuelan prison gang.
When Abrego Garcia was arrested in March 2019, a police informant told police he was an MS-13 member, according to a report known as a ""gang field interview sheet."" A judge initially ruled in 2019 that government evidence about Abrego Garcia’s gang membership was ""trustworthy,"" and was upheld on appeal; later, two federal judges ruled that the government’s information was unsupported. It was based on clothing Abrego Garcia wore at the time of his 2019 arrest and information from what a since-fired police officer called a confidential source.
Abrego Garcia’s attorneys say the MS-13 gang membership accusation was fabricated.
Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have sought to reverse his deportation, but the government has argued that since he left U.S. jurisdiction, it cannot take action. The U.S. Supreme Courtruledthat the government must ""facilitate"" Abrego Garcia’s release. (Abrego Garcia has since been moved to a lower-security prison, according tonews reports.)
As for the pictorial tattoos on Abrego Garcia’s hand, marijuana leaves, crosses and skulls are widely used by people who do not belong to gangs. Gang crime experts said they did not stand out to them as MS-13 markers.
""I don’t believe a ‘dangerous individual’ would have such anodyne and farcically generic tattoos on his hand,"" said Liliana Castañeda Rossmann, a California State University San Marcos emerita professor of communication and author of the book ""Transcending Gangs: Latinas Story Their Experience.""
Sean Kennedy, a former federal public defender in California and now a Loyola Law School professor, said that in his experience representing and interacting with current and former MS-13 members, ""The tattoos in the photo don't look familiar to me.""
Such designs are out of character with typical MS-13 tattoos, Kennedy said.
""Within MS-13 culture, such markings would likely be frowned upon and even viewed as a sign of cowardice, as they could be interpreted as an attempt to hide or downplay gang affiliation,"" Kennedy said. ""That type of concealment goes against the gang's norms, which often demand bold, visible demonstrations of identity and loyalty.""
Charles Katz, director of Arizona State University’s Center for Violence Prevention and Community Safety, concurred.
While Katz said that local law enforcement would be more familiar with specific tattoo designs in a given region, ""I have worked on issues related to MS-13 for the past 15 years in El Salvador and the U.S. and I have never seen tattoos or graffiti suggesting that these particular tattoos are associated with MS-13.""
Experts said tattoos can be helpful in identifying gang members, as long as they are one of multiple pieces of evidence.
""While police gang experts often use so-called gang tattoos as circumstantial evidence of alleged gang involvement, in my experience, they never use tattoos alone as definitive evidence of gang affiliation,"" said David M. Kennedy, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor who studies gangs. ""This is particularly true where, as here, the tattoos are ambiguous and may reflect things other than gang ties, such as religion, loss, personal transformation or cultural identity.""
Trump said Abrego Garcia ""had ‘MS-13’ on his knuckles tattooed. … He had ‘MS’ as clear as you can be. Not 'interpreted.’""
The figures M, S, 1 and 3 and the words below the symbols don’t appear in other photographs of Abrego Garcia’s hand, including one shared by the Salvadoran government.
Experts in MS-13 and other gangs say the pictorial tattoos shown are not typical designs for MS-13 or other gangs, and they say that several of those tattoos are commonly used by people unaffiliated with gangs.

Claim about Trump rejecting Helene relief for North Carolina lacks context,Paul Specht,"April 24, 2025","A widely-shared social media post lacks important context about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s recent decision about disaster relief in North Carolina.
President Donald Trump ""just denied North Carolina’s request for FEMA relief from Hurricane Helene, calling it ‘unwarranted,’"" liberal pundit Brian Tyler Cohen said in an April 12X post.
The post — which reached 6.6 million X accounts, according to the company’s metrics — could give people the impression that North Carolina has been left to deal with Helene relief on its own.
That’s not the case. In a follow-upX post, Cohen linked to anews articlethat provided more context. Cohen didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Helene hit North Carolina on Sept. 27 and is the most devastating storm in state history, killing more than 100 people and causing an estimated $60 billion in damage, according to state officials.
FEMA initially agreed to pay for 100% of debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 180 days, or until March 27. A week prior to that expiration date, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat who was elected to the office in November, wrote a letter to Trump asking him to extend the agreement.
""This extension is critical to make Western North Carolina whole and is in alignment with executive actions from previous storms like Hurricane Maria in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, Hurricane Ike in Texas, and Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and Mississippi,"" Stein wrote.
In an April 11response, a top FEMA administrator informed Stein that his request had been denied, saying 100% federal coverage was ""not warranted."" The letter didn’t explain its decision. In a statement to PolitiFact NC, FEMA’s press office said that the agency normally covers 75% of the cost — but will continue paying for 90% of debris removal.
""FEMA initially provided a 100% federal cost share to incentivize speedy debris removal operations and recovery,"" FEMA said in an April 16 statement. ""The typical assistance FEMA provides through its Public Assistance Program is 75%, due to the severity of the disaster with Hurricane Helene, FEMA is providing North Carolina 90% far exceeding the normal 75%.""
After receiving FEMA’s letter, Stein issued a statement saying he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision and would ""urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.""
Stein’s office told PolitiFact NC that the difference in covering 90% of the costs and 100% of the costs is an estimated $200 million. That’s money that could be used on other Helene-related projects, or saved as legislators strive toslash state spending. North Carolina budget analysts say the state could face abudget deficitnext year due to declining revenues from tax cuts.
Cohen claimed on X that Trump ""denied North Carolina’s request for FEMA relief from Hurricane Helene.""
The vague post could give people the inaccurate impression that Trump is withholding all relief from North Carolina. That’s not the case.
FEMA, which operates under the Trump administration, denied a request to cover 100% of North Carolina’s costs for debris removal and other emergency protective measures — but will continue covering 90% of costs as those efforts continue.
Cohen’s claim is partially accurate — a request for relief was rejected — but leaves out the important detail that FEMA is still funding 90% of relief. We rate it Half True.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/apr/24/brian-tyler-cohen/claim-about-trump-rejecting-helene-relief-for-nort/
"Is gas $1.98 a gallon in a few U.S. states, as Donald Trump said? That’s False",Louis Jacobson,"April 24, 2025","Twice in recent days, President Donald Trump has touted the lows he says gas prices have reached during his presidency.
""You have gasoline that hit $1.98 yesterday in a couple of states,"" TrumpsaidApril 17 while meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
He repeated that statistic in another White House event April 22.
""I see that we had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon,"" Trumpsaid. ""Nobody thought they'd see that for years maybe. And that's a big thing. And we opened up our wells, we opened up our drilling.""
But no state has had an average gasoline price close to $1.98 per gallon in recent weeks. The lowest per-gallon price we could find of all U.S. gas stations was $2.11 at onestation, as of April 23, according to a company that tracks prices at stations across the U.S.
Energy experts also expressed doubt that Trump’s pro-drilling policies have affected the recent price of gasoline.
The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check.
The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline the week of Trump’s most recent remark was either $3.14, according to the federalEnergy Information Administration, or $3.17, according to the industry groupAmerican Automobile Association.
Texashad the lowest statewide price cited by the Energy Information Administration, at $2.66 per gallon, andMississippi hadthe lowest statewide price in the American Automobile Association data set, at $2.68.
Both of those prices are one-third higher than the amount Trump cited.
The last timeTexashad a statewide price under $1.98 per gallon was in January 2021, when the coronavirus pandemic lowered gasoline demand because of decreased travel and commuting. The last time before that was in April 2016.
Checking GasBuddy.com, which tracks gas prices at individual stations across the country, we found no station in the U.S. offering gasoline at $1.98 per gallon.
Initially, we found one station in GasBuddy’s database that was listed as selling gasoline for 1.99 a gallon, the Sam’s Club in Mooresville, North Carolina. But when we called the location, they said this appears to be a prank report; their actual price is $2.69.
The national average price of gasoline has fallen in recent weeks, according to the Energy Information Administration. After peaking at $3.24 per gallon the week of April 7, the average price fell for two consecutive weeks, to $3.14 the week of April 21.
Trump said ""we opened up our wells, we opened our drilling."" Energy experts said the gasoline price drops do not appear to be connected to Trump energy policies; instead, they are related to increased international oil production and economic forces.
The standard source for trackingoil rig usage— from Baker Hughes, an energy technology company — shows that the number of rigs in use has been largely flat in recent months.
There’s no sign of increased U.S. oil production.
""North Dakota tends to report numbers quickly, and there'sno evidence of an uptick in production there,"" said Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
InTexasandNew Mexico, two other significant oil-producing states, oil production declined in February, said Hugh Daigle, an associate petroleum and geosystems engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
Williams-Derry attributes the recent gasoline price declines to two factors.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, which does not include the U.S., has announced that it isincreasingproduction. Boosting production means increasing supply, which, all other things being equal, usually lowers prices.
The second factor has to do with ""economic jitters related to trade and political uncertainties,"" Williams-Derry said. Trump’s tariffs ""have reduced projected economic growth, both in the U.S. and globally, which hasreducedprojected growth in global oil demand. ""
Increased U.S. oil production would not be guaranteed to lower gasoline prices, because the oil would flow into the global market supply and potentially be canceled out by other countries’ production declines.
""Realistically, there is little that can be done on the policy side to make a large difference in gasoline prices, as they are subject to global supply and demand forces,"" Daigle said.
Trump said, ""We had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon.""
The lowest statewide price during the week Trump made this remark was $2.66.
April 23 data from GasBuddy.com shows that no gas station out of roughly 150,000 nationally sold gasoline for $1.98 per gallon.
While Trump said his policies are responsible for lowering gasoline prices nationally, there is no evidence of a significant uptick in drilling or production. Analysts credit a gasoline price drop during the past two weeks to a production increase by other countries, and concerns about Trump’s policies hurting the U.S. global and economic outlook.

"Firearm-related deaths are No. 1 killer of college-age people, data shows",Loreben Tuquero,"April 22, 2025","After a gunman at Florida State University killed two people and wounded at least six others, an advocacy group posted about firearm-related deaths.
""Gun violence is the leading killer of college-aged people in the U.S.,"" Moms Demand Action, part of gun violence prevention organization Everytown for Gun Safety,posted April 17 on Threads. ""Our young people deserve better.""
According to health experts and the most recent data, the statement is accurate for firearm-related deaths in this class of young people.
Everytown for Gun Safety released a2023 reportciting 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing firearms are the No. 1 mechanism of death for people ages 18 to 25. Everytown for Gun Safety spokesperson Katie Wertheimer also pointed to a2022 articlepublished in the journal Pediatrics that found ""firearms are the leading cause of death in children and youth 0 to 24 years of age in the United States.""
PolitiFact queried the CDC’sWeb-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting Systemfor data on the most recent injury deaths for ages 18 to 25. In 2023, firearms were the mechanism that accounted for the most deaths in that age group, at 8,086. For ages 24 and 25, drug poisoning was the top cause.
CDC data showed accidents, followed by suicide and homicide, were the leading causes of death among people ages 18 to 25. These categories all include firearm-related deaths. Brian Tsai, a CDC spokesperson, told PolitiFact that although the agency does not rank firearm deaths as a leading cause of death because they occur across categories, ""our data does show that firearms are the leading mechanism of injury mortality.""
""Categories for ranking cause of death must be mutually exclusive and it has been CDC's longstanding policy to rank the homicide, suicide and unintentional injury categories,"" Tsai said in an email. ""CDC does not classify firearms as a cause of death, but rather as a mechanism by which death occurs (same is true for motor vehicle accidents).""
The CDC considers unintentionalfirearm injuriesas ""fatal or nonfatal firearm injuries that happen while someone is cleaning or playing with a firearm or other incidents of an accidental firing without evidence of intentional harm.""
In 2023, CDC data showed unintentional injuries (14,238) were the leading cause of death among people ages 18 to 25, followed by suicide (5,632) and homicide (5,060). Narrowing down to deaths by firearm, the majority were homicides (4,651), followed by suicides (3,158).
Gun-rights advocatesquestionwhether the term ""gun violence"" should include suicides. Countries such asCanadaandAustraliainclude firearm suicidein that term.Surveys about gun violenceuse varying language and criteria on including suicides.
Daniel Webster, distinguished scholar for the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, told PolitiFact the Moms Demand Action statement is accurate.
Veronica Pear, a University of California Davis School of Medicine social epidemiologist and assistant professor, also said the statistic is accurate, based on 2023 mortality data, noting that ""gun violence"" includes suicide and homicide.
Wertheimer referred PolitiFact to a2024 articleby KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, that said firearm-related deaths among ages 18 to 25 ""are predominantly due to homicides.""
Shootings on school and college grounds appear to make up a small portion of firearm-related deaths among people ages 18 to 25. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, there have been463 deaths from gunfire on school groundssince 2013. An average of 4,300 children and teens, up to age 19, were shot and killed per year from 2019 to 2023, Everytown for Gun Safety reported.
Moms Demand Action said ""gun violence is the leading killer of college-aged people in the U.S.""
Accidental deaths ranked No. 1 for people ages 18 to 25 in 2023, and firearms were the ""leading mechanism,"" according to the CDC.

"Putting claim about ""largest tax increase"" in context",Jill Terreri Ramos,"April 22, 2025","The largest tax increase in American history?
That’s what Rep. Michael Lawler claims would happen if Congress does not pass a budget reconciliation bill by the end of the year.
""The president is focused, as is Congress, on getting a reconciliation bill passed, that actually passes a tax bill, that is critical,""Lawler said recentlyon NewsNation. ""If we don’t pass the tax bill by the end of the year, we will have the largest tax increase in American history.""
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law during Donald Trump’s first term as president, nearly doubled the standard deduction.
In addition,the act limited the amountof state and local taxes filers can deduct to $10,000, cut the corporate tax rate, expanded the child tax credit and reduced marginal income tax rates. Some of the changes in the law are set to expire, while others, like the corporate tax rate cut, will not.
Judging the truthfulness of his claim hinges on how you define ""largest"" tax increase.
The Tax Foundation, which studies federal tax policy,estimatesthat if the expiring individual provisions are made permanent, the average tax rate for all filers would drop from 20.9% to 19.4%, while the share of filers who itemize would decrease from 33% to 13%. Meanwhile, 9% of filers would see a tax increase while 62% of filers would see a tax decrease.
Credibleestimatesof the cost of extending the tax cuts over 10 years are in the $4 trillion to$5.5 trillionrange, but can change depending on how different revenue actions affect other parts of the economy, and whether extending the cuts are considered in the context of other changes.
But what if the tax cuts expire without a replacement bill?
We reached out to Lawler’s office, and his spokesperson pointed us to ananalysisin May from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Allowing the tax cuts to expire would result in the single most significant tax increase by dollar amount in history, an estimated $4.6 trillion revenue increase over a decade, from fiscal year 2025 to 2034, including interest.
Lawler’s claim relies on looking at the cost of extending the expiring cuts as a total dollar figure over 10 years – not as a percentage of gross domestic product, which is the wayeconomists measurethe impact of tax changes across history.
So a PolitiFact ruling isn't as clear-cut as one may think.
""The single best measure for most purposes is probably the revenue effect as a percentage of GDP, because it eliminates the effects of inflation, real economic growth, and the size of total federal receipts,"" according to a report fromthe U.S. Treasury Department. ""The second-best measure is probably constant dollars, because it eliminates the effects of inflation and the size of total federal receipts.""
Clearly, the expiration of the tax cuts would result in a significant tax increase. But as an annual percentage of GDP, the expiration of the tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would not be the largest in history, experts told us.
The Tax Foundation, which tracks tax policy and supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, compiled a list of the largest tax increases in history, measuring the revenue changes as an annual percentage of GDP. It estimates that in 2026, if the income tax cuts are extended, revenue would be reduced by $342.4 billion, or 1.08% of GDP. If the tax cuts are not extended, the tax increase would be substantial, but it would not be the largest ever in history, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy.
Six tax law changes between 1941 and 1968 led to bigger tax increases as a percent of GDP, York said.
""The expiration (of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax cuts) would, however, be the largest peacetime tax increase, coming in just above the 1982 tax law that increased taxes by .98 percent of GDP,"" she said.
There are constant dollar comparisons over time that put the first year of extending the Trump cuts as more expensive than prior increases. But experts said that while those do adjust for inflation, they do not reflect changes in the size of the economy.
A Treasury Department analysis in 2006 found theRevenue Act of 1942cost $73.4 billion in 1992 constant dollars. The first-year cost of extending the Trump tax cuts, in 1992 constant dollars, is $147.8 billion.
Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, warned the Treasury report compares legislated tax increases – not the expiration of tax cuts.
The most comparable situation happened between 2012 and 2013, when a large set of George W. Bush-era tax cuts were scheduled to expire at the same time that a large set of tax extenders and temporary tax cuts enacted in the aftermath of the Great Recession were scheduled to expire. That would have resulted in a tax increase of$500 billion in a single year, in 2013 dollars, Rosenberg said. That would be $694 billion today. Congress extended some of those tax cuts in the American Taxpayer Relief Act.
""So, I don't think there is any question that the total amount of tax increases originally scheduled to take effect between 2012 and 2013 were larger than what is scheduled to occur next year,"" Rosenberg said. ""Congress ultimately voted to extend a large portion of those tax cuts to avoid actually letting that large of a tax increase occur, and I suspect this Congress will be no different.""
Lawler claimed Americans would face the largest tax increase in history if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires.
In pure dollar terms, he’s right.
But economists typically use a percentage of GDP to compare the cost of tax cuts or tax increases across time.
Seen this way, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expiration would not lead to the highest tax increase ever, as a percentage of GDP, although one credible analysis found that it would mark the largest peacetime increase in history.
Because Lawler’s statement is accurate, but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/apr/22/michael-lawler/putting-claim-about-largest-tax-increase-in-contex/

"No, Arizona election officials aren’t removing ‘50,000 noncitizens from voter rolls’",Madison Czopek,"April 18, 2025","After Arizona’s 15 counties reached a settlement in a lawsuit involving state voter rolls, a Fox News headline sparked misleading social media posts about thousands of noncitizens.
""Kinda crazy that Arizona Democrats needed a lawsuit to force them to remove 50,000 noncitizens from voter rolls,"" Rogan O’Handley, a conservative who uses the handle DC_Draino on X,wrote April 13, going on to accuse Democrats of election malfeasance.
His post included a pro-Donald Trump account’sscreen grabof an April 13Fox News headlinethat it described as""huge, monstrous, earthshaking news"": ""SCOOP: Arizona to begin removing as many as 50K noncitizens from voter rolls following lawsuit.""
The original Fox News report misinterpreted what Arizona county election officials agreed to do as part of the legal settlement. Officials agreed to ask the U.S. Homeland Security Department to help verify the citizenship of people on their voter rolls whose citizenship has not been verified. Not all of those people are noncitizens, and the settlement did not include a commitment to remove thousands of people from state voter rolls.
Arizona’sconstitutionprohibits noncitizens from voting in elections, and only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections.
Arizonalawrequiresvoters to provide proof of citizenship when they register to vote. Valid proofincludesan Arizona driver’s license, an Indian Census Number or Indian Affairs Card Number, or a legible copy of naturalization documents, birth certificate or U.S. passport.
Federal law, in contrast, requires only that a person registering to voteattestto their citizenship under penalty of perjury.
This means that people in Arizona who submit valid documentation of citizenship are ""entitled to vote in all federal, state, and local elections in which they are eligible,"" but people who only attest to citizenship are known as being ""federal only"" voters who can vote only in federal elections, according to theArizona Secretary of State.
As of April 1, Arizona has 46,017federal onlyregistered active and inactive voters. That’s about 1% of the state’s 4.46 millionregistered voters.
Alex Gulotta, Arizona state director for All Voting Is Local, a voting rights advocacy organization, said Arizona’s ""federal only"" voters registered to vote under the same federal requirements as Texas’ 18 million registered voters, for example.
In December, Votebeat Arizona, a news organization that reports on voting issues,reportedthat federal only voters largely include people ""living on Native land, on college campuses and at the state’s main homeless campus.""
""Many of these people are young people and or older snowbird people who may live in Minnesota part of the year and Arizona part of the year, but they don’t have an Arizona state driver’s license,"" Gulotta said. An Arizona driver’s license is the easiest way to establish citizenship, he said.
In September, the conservative political advocacy group America First Legal, working on behalf of  the civic action website EZAZ.org,suedall of Arizona’s 15 counties,allegingthey failed ""to take action to remove foreign citizens from their voter rolls."" The lawsuitarguedthat county election officials had ""ignored"" and ""failed to perform"" state and federal voter list maintenance requirements. It said officials didn’t use all available federal databases — including one from the Homeland Security Department — to help verify citizenship.
On April 8, the Maricopa County Recorder’s office, whichledsettlement negotiations,announcedthe parties reached an agreement. The statementsaidthe office had ""initiated communications"" with the Homeland Security Department, seeking assistance in verifying ""the citizenship status of registered voters who have not provided Documentary Proof of Citizenship.""
The parties’ April 9dismissalnotice said that the counties had ""agreed to ask DHS to begin responding to requests"" to help ""verify the citizenship of each county’s federal-only voters.""
Fox News’ storysaidthat the settlement meant county officials were starting ""the process of verifying and removing noncitizens from their voter rolls, including nearly 50,000 registrants who did not provide proof of U.S. citizenship.""
Sam Stone, Maricopa County Recorder’s Office spokesperson, toldVotebeat Arizonathat Fox News’ story was wrong.
Arizona counties did not agree to remove 50,000 noncitizens or 50,000 ineligible voters from its voter rolls. The settlement said only that counties would pursue an additional means to verify the citizenship of registered ""federal only"" voters.
As a result of the settlement, Stone said the counties were asking Homeland Security officials ""to provide an additional way for county officials to check voter citizenship,"" Votebeat Arizonareported.
In the days that followed, Fox Newschanged its story’s headlineto, ""Arizona to verify up to 50K people from voter rolls who failed to prove citizenship."" The start of the story now says the counties have started the process of ""verifying and removing voters,"" rather than ""noncitizens."" The outlet also added an editor’s note: ""This story has been updated to reflect that the AZ voters on the rolls under examination did not prove their citizenship at the time of registration.""
Fox News did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for information about what prompted the change.
Gulotta said that even cross-checking registered voters’ information with Homeland Security’s database wouldn’t necessarily determine if ""federal only"" voters are U.S. citizens. The database would only have citizenship information on people connected to the immigration system, such as green-card holders.
""If you were born on the Navajo Nation, you’re not in that database,"" Gulotta said. ""If you were born in the United States somewhere, you’re not in that database.""
With the settlement, county election officials agreed to try to verify citizenship another way, but Gulotta said assertions that 50,000 people who are not eligible to vote are being removed from voter rolls because of the lawsuit are ""absolutely untrue.""
An X post said Arizona Democrats ""needed a lawsuit to force them to remove 50,000 noncitizens from voter rolls.""
This mischaracterized what Arizona county election officials agreed to do as part of the legal settlement. Officials agreed to ask the U.S. Homeland Security Department to help verify the citizenship of people on their voter rolls whose citizenship has not been verified.

"Can voters use Real ID to satisfy SAVE Act voting rules, as Byron Daniels said? Not in 44 states.",Grace Abels,"April 18, 2025","Responding to concerns about a bill that would require proof of citizenship to vote, some Republicans have said an eligible voter needs only a Real ID.
But in 44 states, that’s not a solution.
TheSafeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, passed the U.S. House on April 10 by a 220-208vote. A priority of Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump, it would require in-person proof of citizenship, such as a U.S. passport or a combination of a driver's license and birth certificate, to register to vote.Republicans say the SAVE Act — which has a high 60-vote hurdle to clear in the Senate — is necessary to ensure that noncitizens don’t vote in U.S. elections. Federal laws already prohibit noncitizens from voting in federal elections, and cases of noncitizens voting areextremely rare.
Democrats denounced the bill as a threat to voting rights, criticizing the required paperwork as burdensome; abouthalf of Americansdon’t have passports, for example. Republicans accused Democrats of exaggerating the burden.
""To the people who are concerned about married women being able to register (to vote) there's this thing in the United States, every state does it now, called Real ID,"" said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., in an April 10NewsNation interview. ""As long as you have a Real ID, which virtually every American has to have today, it should be easy for you to register to vote.""
Sen.Mike Lee, R-Utah, and several socialmediausersmadesimilarstatementsabout Real IDs allowing people to travel and vote.
Real IDsarefederally compliant, state-issued driver’s licenses or identification cards that require documentation including a Social Security card and proof of citizenship or legal immigration status to obtain. Congress passed a 2005 law requiring state-issued IDs to meet federal minimum security standards following a 9/11 Commission recommendation.
A Real ID card is typically marked with ablack or gold star. About56%of American IDs were Real ID compliant in January 2024, but many people are rushing to get Real IDs before aMay 7 deadlineafter which a non-Real ID driver’s license, for example, will not be sufficient toboard domestic flights. (Some states, such as Illinois, are saying ""Real ID can wait"" because of high demand.)
However, not every Real ID meets SAVE Act requirements to prove citizenship. The SAVE Act accepts only Real IDs that indicate whether a person is a citizen, which most do not.
Further,Real IDscan be issued to noncitizens with lawful status, including permanent residence, temporary protected status, refugees, asylum applicants and people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Homeland Security Department’swebsitesays.
Five states — Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington — offer a version of Real ID that indicates whether a person is a U.S. citizen, called anenhanced driver’s license.These licenses are offered at an additional fee, so not every Real ID in those states is compliant with the SAVE Act. Homeland Security officials have been working since2008to bring the enhanced ID program to all states.
One more state,Idaho, in 2023 began offering IDs with an optional citizenship marker, although it’s unclear whether all are Real ID compliant.
Roughly14% of theU.S. populationlives in those six states. Florida, where Donalds is running for governor,does not show citizenshipon its Real ID.
PolitiFact found no evidence that the remaining states issue Real IDs that comply with the citizenship proof required by the SAVE Act.
Thirty-six statesalready have some form of voter ID law requiring identity verification at the polls, but the SAVE Act would implement hurdles in every state at an earlier step — voter registration. For most states, that is new terrain.
""There is only one state in the U.S., Arizona, that has experience with proof-of-citizenship to register to vote,"" said Lori Minnite, a Rutgers University political science professor and expert in voter fraud.
For state and local elections, Arizona acceptsstate IDsasproof of citizenshipafter comparing the driver’s license number to existing information in its Department of Transportationdatabase. The physical IDs are no different than those issued to noncitizens. It is unclear whether such an ID, only distinguishable from a noncitizen ID when referenced against internal state data, would count as ""indicating"" citizenship under the SAVE Act.
The SAVE Act’s author, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas,acknowledgedin a recent hearing on the bill that only a few states offer compliant licenses, and he hoped more would follow: ""We believe, right, that the structure is put in place now that allow — I think there’s at least five states that do have the citizenship status as part of the Real ID — encourage more states to do so, right? That would be part of the goal here.""
In2023, Ohio passed a law to offer enhanced driver's licenses, but it is notyet acceptingapplications.IowaandMontanaare considering bills to add a citizenship marker on IDs.
Neither Donalds nor Roy responded to requests for comment.
For the majority of Americans who don’t live in Idaho or one of the few states with enhanced IDs, the SAVE Act says they can prove citizenship with a valid U.S. passport; a military ID card and a military service record showing place of birth; or a government issued photo-ID that shows place of birth.Those documents, or a Real ID that indicates citizenship, are the only ones that can prove citizenship on their own under the bill. Without one of those, a person must show a driver’s license or identification along with another document showing birthplace, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate, consular report of birth abroad or final adoption decree.
All documents must be presented in person.
Any mismatch between documents and someone’s current identification cards could disrupt voter registration. Mismatches are common for people who change their namesfollowing marriage.
In the same hearing, Roy said the SAVE Act would not affect people currently registered to vote.
He added: ""If they have an intervening event or if the states want to clean the rolls, people would come forward to register to demonstrate their citizenship so we could convert our system over some reasonable time to a citizenship-based registration system.""
Jonathan Diaz, director of voting, advocacy and partnerships at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization that supports voting rights, said he believes the SAVE Act would apply to any updates to current registration or reregistration.
AsprominentDemocratswarned that thebillwouldmake voting harder formillionsof married women, SAVE Actsupporterssaid the bill addresses the needs of people with name changes by leaving it up to the states to decide what documentation would be required to resolve document discrepancies. It directs each state to ""establish a process under which an applicant can provide such additional documentation"" to establish citizenship if the person’s documents don’t include matching information.
Minnite called this language ambiguous: ""Could a married woman who does not have a passport and who changed her name use a marriage certificate to prove her citizenship? The SAVE Act is not clear.""Diaz said, ""Different states could have different standards and different degrees of proof needed, which will be really hard for voters to navigate.""
Donalds said under the SAVE Act, ""as long as you have a Real ID … it should be easy for you to register to vote."" Most Real IDs are not compliant with the citizenship proof required under the SAVE Act. PolitiFact identified just six states that offer Real IDs that show citizenship, and five of them require an additional fee for that type.
People living in the remaining 44 states would need other forms of documentation to register to vote under the SAVE Act, such as a U.S. passport, a military service ID and record, or a birth certificate with a drivers license.
Donalds’ statement has an element of truth because in a handful of states, people have access to Real IDs that would be sufficient to register to vote under the SAVE Act. But he ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the statement Mostly False.

Fact-checking Gov. Tim Walz on Americans’ savings,Claire Cranford,"April 16, 2025","As President Donald Trump’s tariffs dominated headlines, former Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz talked about his party’s messaging on the economy.
Many Americans have a sense of economic angst that the Trump campaign tapped into before the 2024 election, Walz told CNN’s Jake Tapper on April 6. Democrats, he argued, need to do a better job reaching those voters.""They're concerned that their economic future is so precarious it could slip out from under them,""Walz said. ""Less than half of Americans have $1,000 in savings.""
Research shows Americans do not feel financially stable, but Walz exaggerated the health of Americans’ savings accounts by giving the impression that nearly half have anemic reserves.
Walz’s team did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. We found data on the topic in an August 2024 Forbes survey, whichreportedthat the share of Americans with $1,000 or less in their savings accounts is closer to 28%.
Around one-third of Generation Z and millennials have less than $1,000 in their savings, the survey results showed. The number decreases for older generations: 27% of Generation X and 20% of baby boomers have less than $1,000 in savings. However, a little more than half of both generation groups reported having less than $5,000 saved.
Other surveys had similar findings.
The 2023 Federal Reserve Bank’s most recent consumer financesurveybased on 2022 data concluded that Americans’ median value of savings that year was $39,000, not including equities and real estate . It also found that 99% of families had at least one bank account, stock, bond or other type of financial asset as savings.
The data did not control for savings accounts specifically. But in transaction accounts — which can include savings, checking and money market accounts — the median holding amount was $8,000.A February 2025surveyby Bankrate, a consumer financial services company, found that 40% of Americans said they would use their savings in the event of a $1,000 emergency expense — but that 41% wouldn’t have enough savings to cover the cost. It also found that about 37% of people dipped into their savings in the past year. Of that 37%, more than half withdrew more than $1,000.
Although Walz’s statistic is exaggerated, surveys corroborate the notion that Americans are struggling to save.
""We are essentially a paycheck-to-paycheck nation,"" Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamricksaidin a press release. ""Fewer Americans have the equivalent of a financial safety net to cover inevitable unexpected expenses, despite low unemployment and steady growth. This is one of the consequences of elevated prices stemming from inflation.""
Forbes found that respondents cited the rising cost of living as the main reason they couldn’t save more.
Personal finance expertsrecommendsaving at least three months’ of living expenses. Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said most advisers say a person’s emergency savings balance alone should be about three to six months of usual monthly spending.
Bankrate found that41%of Americans have at least three months’ worth of expenses in savings.
Walz said, ""Less than half of Americans have $1,000 in savings.""
The percentage of Americans with $1,000 or less in savings accounts isn’t close to half. A 2024 Forbes survey found it's 28%, or closer to one quarter.
Other recent data from Bankrate and the Federal Reserve paints a rosier picture of Americans’ financial savings than Walz did, but personal finance experts say most Americans do not have enough savings.
Walz’s statement has an element of truth but his numbers are inaccurate. We rate his claim Mostly False.

Photo of PA arson suspect Cody Balmer was falsely edited to show anti-Trump sentiment,Madison Czopek,"April 14, 2025","After authorities announced Cody Balmer, 38, was a suspect in the April 13 arson attack on the Pennsylvania governor’s residence, social media users combed through his online posts to find anything that might explain his motive.
Multiple social media users circulated an image of Balmer that included anti-Trump profanity as proof he held liberal political beliefs.
""This is the democrat who set Governor Shapiro’s house on fire,"" Philip Andersonwroteon X April 13, sharing a photo of a man wearing an industrial dust mask with a cigarette poked through it. Red text on the photo read ""F--- Trump.""
Anderson, of Smith County, Texas, was criminally charged forhis actionson Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol. In January, the courtdismissedthe case at the Justice Department’s request. The photo was also shared onFacebook.
PolitiFact found a Facebook account for a person named Cody Balmer whose birthday matched the date of birth listed in thecriminal complaintagainst Balmer.
The last public post on the page was in July 2023. Years earlier, on April 16, 2020, the accountshared the same photoof a bearded man wearing the face mask with a cigarette poking out.
The 2020 Facebook post did not include red, anti-Trump text, however. The only words that accompanied the photo were in thepost’s caption, which read: ""Stay safe out there.""
Balmer’s political affiliations are unknown. The Pennsylvania Department of Statewebsite showsBalmer is an active voter but claims no party affiliation.
Balmer’s criminal history included traffic violations, theft and forgery charges that resulted in a probation sentence and a pending 2023 assault charge for which he was set to appear in court this week,The Associated PressandUSA Todayreported.
His mother, Christine Balmer of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,told APthat Balmer had bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and she’d been trying to get him mental health help. Shetold CBSNews that her son is ""mentally ill and he went off his medication"" before the attack.

""Jasmine Crockett says she 'simply forgot' to inform Social Security that her grandmother died in 2012,"" an April 5 TikTokpostsaid, sharing a photo of Crockett. ""She's been collecting $2,600 a month for 13 years.""
The claim took off in English and Spanish. A listener called aSpanish radio stationin Miami on April 10 to ask the host about its veracity.
But this is a recycled claim that originated from a self-described satire website. We found no credible news reports or public statements from Crockett about this claim. Crockett’s office did not respond to our questions.

"Critics of ‘Hands Off’ protests mislead with photos, videos they say are proof of paid protestors",Grace Abels,"April 11, 2025","Soon after hundreds of thousands of people gathered in cities across the world to protest the Trump administration’s government program cuts, critics of the effort cast doubt on its authenticity.
""Exposed: Anti-Elon protests are staged & paid — bussed-in, scripted, clocked-out,"" conservative influencer Mario Nawfal postedApril 6on X. The post refers to billionaire and White House adviser Elon Musk, who was one focus of the protests. Musk leads Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is acost-cutting agency.More than1,000""Hands Off""proteststookplacein50 statesandabroad, but Nawfal’s post focused on the Washington, D.C., event: ""The anti-Elon, anti-DOGE, anti-Trump protests in D.C.? They aren’t grassroots. They are payroll-driven theater,"" the post said.
We examined Nawfal’s post and others like it and found the supposed evidence they presented that the ""Hands Off"" events were a pay-for-protest job did not hold up to scrutiny. Many posts misleadingly framed normal aspects of event organizing, such as printed signs and coordinated transportation, as signs of a paid conspiracy. Some posts mistook a viral satire video as fact, and others misidentified a paid signature gatherer for a protester.""We don’t pay protesters. We don’t ‘stage’ protests,"" said Sarah Dohl, the chief campaigns officer of Indivisible, a nonprofit which has been a focus of claims about paid protesters. ""What we do is support a nationwide network of grassroots organizers working to protect democracy.""
We found no evidence that April 5 protesters in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere were paid to protest. Nawfal did not respond to a request for comment.
Nawfal’s post included four videos,threeofwhichwerefirstshared by Laura Loomer, a conservative activist and podcaster who has promotedconspiracy theories, including that 9/11 was ""an inside job."" Some of the videos appear to show aMarch for Palestinethat was happening in Washington, D.C., the same day as the ""Hands Off"" protest. Nawfal’s post said protestors had ""pre-made signs handed out assembly-line style.""
Two of the videos showed large groups of people walking down Washington, D.C.’s 15th Street. Several protesters in the group carried signs that said, ""Socialism Beats Fascism."" Those signsmatchthe political action group Democratic Socialists of America’s signs from theApril 5 protest. That group did not respond to a request for comment.Distributing signs at protests is not abnormal and not a sign that the people carrying them are paid, saidCelina Su, a  City University of New York political science professor and expert in grassroots organizing.
""We want the grassroots to be somewhat organized,"" Su said. ""This doesn't mean that they're in group think, like drinking the Kool Aid of propaganda. This means that there's been meetings talking about what their campaign priorities and they're like, ‘Yeah, let's focus on this.’""
Nawfal’s post also said ""buses rolled in packed with hired protesters,"" and two of his other video clips focused on buses. Oneshowedpeople disembarking a bus. Anothershoweda bus’s luggage area where two handmade signs appeared to have been stored.
It’s not uncommon for people to ride buses into a big city — where parking can be both scarce and expensive — for a major event. ""Those charter buses, to me, prove that this is a widespread sentiment, not that they were paid to express this sentiment,"" Su said.Some protesters organized buses to travel into Washington, D.C., toparticipatein both the ""Hands Off"" protest and theMarch for Palestine. Local groupsset upwebsitesfor people seeking tocoordinatetheirtravelto the events, including waysparticipantscould pay for theirown tickets.
PolitiFact contacted several groups that helped organize April 5 events, including MoveOn, Indivisible and 50501, which was specifically formed to protest the second Trump administration. Each organization said it did not pay protesters to participate and was unaware of any organization that would. Similarly, the groups said they neither paid for nor organized buses to bring protesters to Washington, D.C.
The last video in Nawfal’s post featuredBronson Alford, aconservative influencerwho was filming interviews forTurning Point USA, a conservative advocacy group.
In the video, Alford said that after he left for a 30 minute break, he returned to find the crowd had dispersed. ""This place is dead… not a single protester in sight,"" he said in the video. ""And just 20 to 30 minutes ago, it was completely packed with protesters.""
He concluded the crowd’s absence meant ""they were paid and their time was gone"" or they are a ""cult, and they all left at once."" Nawfal had said in his post that ""protesters all left at once — just like a shift change.""Turning Point USA did not respond to our questions about what time Alford’s video was filmed, butthe landmarksseen in the video show he was standing near the Hirshhorn Museum, about a15-minute walkfrom where the protest was focused, around theWashington Monument.
Lastly, Nawfal linked to hisMarch 31 X postthat said one of the ""Hands Off"" event organizers, the progressive advocacy group Indivisible, had offered to pay people to protest Tesla and Musk. The post included screengrabs of Indivisible’s website with a link to an ""Event Reimbursement Form.""The screenshot was from Indivisible’scongressional recess campaign, which encourages people to organize in their communities when Congress is on break. It offers groups that register with Indivisible ""the option to apply for up to $200 in reimbursement for event-related costs,"" Dohl told PolitiFact in an email.
""Reimbursements require receipts, are submitted after the event, and only cover actual organizing expenses like venue rentals, printed flyers, posterboard, snacks, bullhorn batteries, or accessibility support like (American Sign Language) interpreters,"" Dohl said.So far in 2025, Indivisible has distributed about $7,000 in reimbursements, during the February and March recess periods, Dohl said. There were no reimbursements distributed for the April 5 marches because they happened outside the April 12 to 27 congressional recess period.Indivisible has atoolkitwith downloadable signs and provided free event boxes to 200 ""Hands Off"" protester groups; the boxes included placards, stickers and paint pens.
Su said premade signs, organized buses, reimbursements for expenses show organizers’ attempts to make political engagement more accessible.
We examined other social media posts sharing claims that protesters outside of Washington, D.C., were paid and found they were unsubstantiated.
Texas State University buses were privately hired:Severalsocial mediausers, including aTexas state representative,sharedavideotaken in a parking lot inNew Braunfels, Texas,where people boarded buses with Texas State University branding. ""Why are Texas State University buses being used to transport protesters against Trump, Elon, and DOGE? Who’s paying for them?""posted one X user. Texas State University issued astatementthat the private company that runs the university’s bus system is allowed to charter its buses. A private group chartered the buses, not the university.
Viral TikTok of ""paid protester"" is satire:Othersocialmediausersshared a TikTok video of a woman who claimed to be a paid protester. But this video was from aself-described satire account. Its creator later removed the video and posted another videoexplainingthat the first one was not real.

The video’s caption read, ""George Soros agitator admits he gets paid to protest."" But the man in the video was a paid canvasser gathering signatures for theProtect Utah Workerscampaign, not being paid to protest. In the video he is wearing a lanyard that says ""paid circulator,"" and he has a badge that shows he was working forLandslide Political LLC, a political consulting group that hires canvassers.

Several of the posts mentioned 50501 was organizing the protests, but a 50501 spokesperson told PolitiFact that neither its Los Angeles nor Washington, D.C., organizing teams had knowledge of the ads, and it received no proceeds from anything sold.
Concerns about paid protesters aren’t without merit. There are someprominent examplesof it happening, and it has a term — astroturfing — referring to fake ""grass"" roots.
However, ""most in-person protests are less likely to be astroturfing,"" Su said. ""If it's happening in unexpected places, in different sizes, if you see a diversity of folks,"" of different ages for example, those are all signs it is an authentic grassroots campaign.

"US trade deficit with China is less than $300 billion, not $1 trillion, as Donald Trump said",Louis Jacobson,"April 11, 2025","While hosting race car drivers at the White House, President Donald Trump explained his decision to pause country-by-country tariffs, while raising tariffs on goods imported from China, whichare now145%.
Trump focused on the importance of weaning the U.S. off Chinese goods.
""China was by far the biggest abuser in history,"" he said at theApril 9 event. ""Somebody had to do it. They had to stop because it was not sustainable. Last year, China made $1 trillion off trade with the United States. That’s not right.""
Trump repeated the $1 trillion figure five times over the week, describing it as both a ""surplus""forChina and alossor ""deficit"" for the U.S.
China did not make $1 trillion off trade with the United States in 2024.
The best estimate for China’s 2024 trade surplus with the U.S. is between one-quarter and one-third of that amount, depending on what metric is used.
We looked at 2024 trade data forgoods aloneand forgoods and services. Although the total value of Chinese exports to the U.S. and the U.S. trade deficit with China are both well above what they were more than 15 years ago, none of the figures come close to $1 trillion.
In 2024, the U.S. imported $439 billion in goods from China, and it exported $144 billion there. That left the U.S. with a $295 billion trade deficit for goods alone.
For the broader measure of goods and services, the U.S. imported $463 billion from China in 2024, and exported $199 billion. That’s a trade deficit of $263 billion in goods and services.
Neither the value of China’s exports to the U.S., nor the U.S. trade deficit with China, approached  $1 trillion in 2024.
Those numbers also haven’t come close to $1 trillion in previous years.
The largest value of goods imported from China in any single year was $538.5 billion, in 2018 during Trump’s first administration.
And the widest annual U.S. trade deficit with China in goods and services was $377.7 billion, also in 2018.
The White House did not provide a source for the $1 trillion figure, instead sharing a statement that criticized Democrats’ response to Trump’s action on China.
Trump said in 2024, ""China made $1 trillion off trade with the United States.""
One way to look at his statement is to consider the value of Chinese exports to the U.S. In 2024. China exported $439 billion in goods to the U.S., less than half of Trump’s figure.
Another way is to consider the size of the United States’ trade deficit in goods with China. In 2024, that was $295 billion, less than one-third of what Trump said.
Adding in the U.S. trade in services to the trade in goods leaves a $263 billion deficit with China.

Donald Trump falsely calls 2020 election ‘rigged’ in memo targeting former cybersecurity leader,Maria Ramirez Uribe,"April 10, 2025","As President Donald Trump targeted one of his first-term government officials, he also repeated the long debunked falsehood that the ""2020 election was rigged and stolen.""
In an April 9memo, Trump directed his administration to strip security clearance from Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and investigate Kreb’s time at CISA.
Trump said Krebs ""weaponized"" his authority and ""censored speech.""
""Krebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines.""
Trump repeated that the election was rigged while he signed the memo in the Oval Office on April 9.
""This guy, Krebs, was saying, ‘Oh, the election was great. It was great.’ Well, it’s been proven that it was not only not great ... It was a very corrupt election. They used COVID to cheat,"" Trump said.
""Almost right from the beginning and (Krebs), he’s tried to make the case that this election was a safe election,"" Trump continued. ""I think he said this is the safest election we’ve ever had. And yet, every day you read in the papers about more and more fraud that’s discovered.""
The 2020 election was neither rigged nor stolen. Joe Bidenwon. States certified the results, Congress accepted the results and Biden was inaugurated in January 2021.
Trump’s repeated falsehoods about the 2020 election are not only about revenge and backward looking. He has used falsehoods about the election topush for changesto voting laws.
As the senior Trump administration official responsible for election security and infrastructure, Krebs and his agency affirmed multiple times the 2020 election’s safety.
""The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history,"" the Elections Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council & the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Executive Committees, said in a Nov. 12 statement. ""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""
Krebs’ agency released the statement, but his name was not on it.
Five days later, on Nov. 17, 2020, Krebspostedon X citing alettersigned by 59 election security experts: ""‘In every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent.’""
That day, TrumpfiredKrebs, calling his agency’s reporting ""highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud."" We rated Trump’s statementPants on Fire!
Today, there’s more evidence to refute Trump’s statement about the election’s security.
Biden won the 2020 election afterreceiving 306 electoral votes, compared with 232 for Trump. Biden also got about 7 million more votes nationwide than Trump.
Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits contesting the 2020 election results; they lostmore than 60. The lawsuits failed for various reasons,including that the allegations lacked proof.
In 2022, a group of Republicans, including former federal judges, examined Trump’s statements of fraud and miscount. Theyconcludedthat the claims ""failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the (election) results.""
There werefew, isolated casesof voter fraud in 2020, including by Republicans. Those cases included people casting votes on dead relatives’ behalf and would not have changed the election’s outcome.
Trump said the 2020 election was ""rigged"" and Krebs ""baselessly"" dismissed ""election malfeasance.""
As the senior Trump administration official responsible for election security and infrastructure, Krebs and his agency affirmed the 2020 election’s security.
The 2020 election, one of the most scrutinized and litigated in history, was neither rigged nor stolen.

Fact-check: Trump said tariffs collections are ‘almost $2 billion a day.’ Trade experts are doubtful,Amy Sherman,"April 10, 2025","Before pausing country-by-country tariffs for 90 days, President Donald Trump repeatedly said tariffs were bringing in immense revenue.
At an April 8 executive order signing, Trumpsaid, ""We’re taking in almost $2 billion a day in tariffs. Two billion a day.""
He repeated the $2 billion figure during an April 8speechto the National Republican Congressional Committee. Trump did not cite a source for the figure.
The next day, as financial indicators tumbled,Trump flip-floppedon enacting many of his planned tariffs. Heannounceda 90-day pause on country-by-country tariffs, except for China, which will have a 125% rate. He also let stand a 10% universal tariff and existing levies on Canada and Mexico.
Had the U.S. already collected $2 billion a day from Trump’s existing tariffs?
The U.S. Treasury’s April 8daily statementcontradicts that: It showed $192 million in revenues for custom duties and certain excise taxes.
Customs duties are essentially tariffs, but excise duties are different. Still, the vast majority of the figure should be tariffs, said Robert Koopman, an American University lecturer and former World Trade Organization chief economist.
PolitiFact puts the onus on the speaker to provide evidence, and the Trump administration has provided none. Before and after Trump’s tariff reversal, we asked the White House for Trump’s evidence and received no response.
The tariff collections figure might approach $2 billion if the now-paused tariff rates were applied to past trade amounts. But that would assume that trade levels would remain unchanged when tariffs are in effect, which economists say is doubtful. It would also mean that Trump is counting future projected revenues as having been ""taken in"" already.
""The U.S. is not currently pulling in $2 billion per day from tariffs,"" whether before or after Trump’s pause, said Michael Stanaitis, who teaches international economics courses at American University.
RELATED:Flip flop: Trump said he wasn’t looking at pausing tariffs. Two days later, he did.
Trump could have arrived at $2 billion by using the same formula as Import Genius, a U.S.-based trade data aggregator.
William George, Import Genius’ research director, said he took the sum oftradebased on 2024 data and divided it by 366 days (since 2024 was a leap year) to get an average daily total import value. Then, Import Genius multiplied the daily import values by the tariff rates that were set to kick in to calculate the daily tariff impacts.
Adding those numbers for China, the European Union, Vietnam and Cambodia comes to about$1.8 billion a day. If including the smaller countries, it would increase that number to about $2 billion. George’s calculations assume across-the-board tariffs without industry-specific carve outs such as pharmaceuticals.  (The number rises to about$2.8 billionwhen Trump’s April 9 higher tariff rate for China is used.)
But this theoretical $2 billion result is unlikely in the real world, economists told PolitiFact. Import Genius acknowledged this; Trump has not.
""Here is the big caveat,"" George said. Those estimates are ""looking at 2024 trade numbers. But these policies are going to tremendously suppress trade. We can’t assume that while massively tariffing (U.S. trading partners), trade volumes will remain the same.""
Another caveat is that importers brought in more goods to the U.S. starting in 2024 in anticipation of tariff increases. This means importers might not continue to import at 2024 levels.
""It's trying to have your cake and eat it, too,"" George said. ""It is announcing income under the best possible scenario while looking at the past while not accepting reality that is going to be created by the policies themselves.""
It would take time to assess tariffs’ impact; some goods in transit are exempt if they arrivebefore May 27.
Independent estimates expect the number to fall well short of $2 billion a day.
The Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank,estimatedabout $800 million a day on average in customs duties based on currently applied and scheduled tariffs, as of April 10 — ""nowhere near the amount the president claimed,"" said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy.
Trump’s decision to pause the tariffs kept a 10% tariff in place on all countries, along with higher tariffs on China and existing tariffs on Mexico and Canada. But even after the pause, economists expressed skepticism about the $2 billion per day figure.
""While I suppose this might be plausible, it is improbable because it assumes that thevolumeof imports remains about the same,"" Stanaitis said in an email. ""The U.S. has not had this high of an average tariff rate in over a century, and we can expect that the volume of imports will decrease, thereby lowering revenue expectations.""
A potential U.S. or worldwide recession would ""also be a drag on both consumption of imports and thus tariff revenue,"" Stanaitis said. If tariffs continue to weaken the dollar, imports will rise in price, further suppressing imports.
Some companies that import goods halted shipments amid the whiplash of tariff news.
""I have spoken with many clients (who) are delaying shipments to the United States in the hope that this chaos will be resolved soon,"" Peter Quinter, chair of the U.S. customs and international trade law group at Gunster, Yoakley & Stewart law firm, told PolitiFact shortly before Trump announced his tariff reversal.
Trump said, ""We’re taking in almost $2 billion a day in tariffs.""
Trump provided no evidence for his statement. It’s possible he applied past trade data to project the impact of his  tariffs that have since been rescinded. But such a formula assumes that trade would remain constant in spite of higher tariff rates, and economists said that defies logic.
It will take time to know the tariffs’ impact, but he has not proven that they have already resulted in almost $2 billion a day. The responsibility is on Trump to explain how he arrived at the $2 billion a day figure and he has not done that.
We rate this statement False.

"Ag Secretary Brooke Rollins misleads on trade deficit by cherry picking data, relying on projection",Maria Ramirez Uribe,"April 9, 2025","U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins blamed former President Joe Biden for the rising agricultural trade deficit, while defending President Donald Trump’s tariffs on nearly every country.
""In the last four years, we had an agriculture export deficit that increased from zero when President Trump left to $49 billion,"" Rollins said in an April 6 CNNinterview. She was responding to host Jake Tapper’s question about uncertainty for U.S. farmers amid implementation of Trump’s tariffs.
Trump declared a 90-daypauseon most of his tariffs April 9 after backlash and stock market declines. Trumpdid notpause a 125% tariff on China.
The agriculture trade deficit, when the value of imports exceeds the value of exports, has increased for several years. But Rollins' statement misleads by cherry picking data and blaming Biden and his policies.
The most current data for agriculture exports, from fiscal year 2024 that ended in September, shows a $31.8 billion trade deficit. The $49 billion figure that Rollins cited is a projection for fiscal year 2025, which mainly spans Trump’s current administration.
And the agricultural export deficit was not zero when Trump left office; it was $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2020, Trump’s last full fiscal year during his first term.
USDA did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.
Agricultural economists said there are several reasons why the agricultural trade deficit has grown, and Trump’s tariffs during his first term is a major one.
In February, the Department of Agriculture published areportforecasting agricultural trade for fiscal year 2025, which started in October 2024. The report projected a $49 billion agricultural trade deficit, arecord high. The previous record was set in fiscal year 2024.
Fiscal year 2025 covers about four months of Biden’s administration and about eight months of Trump’s current administration. Also, USDA updates its projections periodically throughout the year, so it’s unclear what the final trade deficit will be for fiscal year 2025 and whether Trump’s current tariffs will affect it.
During Trump’s first term, his administration gave U.S. farmers$28 billion in subsidiesafter tariffs on Chinadecimated the U.S. agricultural export market. The New York Times reported March 31 that the current administration is considering whether to give emergency aid to farmers.
During her CNN interview, Rollins said USDA ""will make sure that we have the funds"" for farmer subsidies if needed.
Historically, the U.S. had an agricultural trade surplus. But in fiscal year 2019, during Trump’s first term, the U.S. recorded its first agricultural trade deficit in nearly 60 years, according to the USDA report.
Since fiscal year 2019, the U.S. has fluctuated between an agricultural trade deficit and surplus. In fiscal years 2019 and 2020, USDA recorded trade deficits of $1.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.
In the first two years of the Biden administration — fiscal years 2021 and 2022 — USDA recorded trade surpluses. In the last two years of the Biden administration, it moved into record-high trade deficits.
There are two ways to potentially reach Rollins’ number of a zero trade deficit, both misleading.
One way is to consider the fiscal year when Trump left office. Fiscal year 2021, which included the last few months of Trump’s first administration, had a trade surplus. But Biden was president during most of that year.
The other way is to look at the calendar year instead of the fiscal year. In the 2020 calendar year, Trump’s last full year in office during his first term, USDAreporteda $3.4 billion agricultural trade surplus. But Rollins’ $49 billion deficit figure aimed at Biden pointed to a fiscal year. Using a fiscal year to blame Biden for a trade deficit and a calendar year to praise Trump for a trade surplus is disingenuous.

Agricultural economists said the agricultural trade deficit has increased for several reasons, including Trump’s first term tariffs, the strength of the U.S. dollar and U.S. consumer demand for imported goods.
Tariffs on China during Trump’s first term
In 2018, Trump implemented tariffs against China. China retaliated by shifting its imports away from the U.S., producing goods domestically or trading with other countries. For example, instead ofimporting soybeansfrom the U.S., China began importing from Brazil.
That ""started the path to (agricultural) deficits,"" William Alan Reinsch, an international trade expert at Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.
The strength of the U.S. dollar
The U.S. dollar’s value has beenrisingsince the Great Recession waned in 2011. That means its exchange rate is higher against other currencies.
A strong dollar canbenefitAmericans traveling overseas, because their dollars buy more local currency. It also makes importsrelatively cheaper. But the strong dollar has also contributed to the agricultural trade deficit, Reinsch said, because U.S. exports cost more overseas.
""The strong US dollar and weakened foreign currencies are making it more difficult for countries to buy US exports,"" Betty Resnick, an agricultural economist,wrotein a February report.
U.S. consumer demand for imported goods
U.S. consumers have strong demand for coffee, year-round access to fruit and vegetables and alcohol. Those are products the U.S. imports in part because they aren’t domestically grown in large enough quantities to meet demand. Increased demand for those products in the U.S. means they have to be imported. And increased imports can affect the trade deficit.
According to the USDA projection, agricultural imports are expected to increase by $4 billion in fiscal year 2025 compared with 2024.
In response to Trump’s tariffs, China announced an 84%retaliatorytariff on U.S. goods starting April 10.
""The major effect will come if other countries retaliate against our tariffs,"" Reinsch said, before China announced retaliatory tariffs. ""Agriculture is usually a prime target when that happens, and, given the additional tariffs being placed on China, you can expect most trade with China to be effectively cut off because of their retaliation.""
Trade relation disruptions as a result of Trump’s tariffs are likely to negatively affect U.S. farmers, the International Food Policy Research Institute, a think tank working to reduce poverty and end hunger, said in areport. The group said other countries such as Brazil and Argentina will likely step in to fill the gaps to sell products the U.S. usually exports, such as soybeans, beef and corn.
""This shift is expected to reshape the global agricultural market,"" the report said.
Rollins said, ""In the last four years, we had an agriculture export deficit that increased from zero when President Trump left to $49 billion.""
The agricultural trade deficit was not zero when Trump left office. In fiscal year 2021, Trump’s last full fiscal year in office during his first term, USDA recorded a $3.7 billion trade deficit. During Trump’s first term, the U.S. recorded its first agricultural trade deficit in nearly 60 years, in part because of tariffs he imposed on China.
The most current data for agriculture exports, from fiscal year 2024 that ended in September, shows a $31.8 billion trade deficit. The $49 billion figure that Rollins cited is a projection for fiscal year 2025, which mostly spans Trump’s current administration.
Attributing changes in the agricultural trade deficit to the president alone is misleading. Some factors that affect the trade deficit are out of the president’s control, such as consumer demand.
Rollins’ statement includes an element of truth because in the last two years of the Biden administration, agriculture trade moved into record-high deficits. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"Flip flop: Trump said he wasn’t looking at pausing tariffs. Two days later, he did.",Amy Sherman,"April 9, 2025","In a reversal of the plan he defended for days, President Donald Trump delayed almost all of the country-by-country tariffs he unveiled April 2.
For two days, Trump and the White House denied that he was considering a pause of the tariff plan shaking global markets.
During an April 7 Oval Office event with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a reporterasked Trump,""Would you be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiation?""
""Well, we're not looking at that,"" Trump said. ""We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals. And in certain cases, they're going to be paying substantial tariffs. They'll be fair deals.""
On April 9 — hours after he told everyone to""BE COOL!""— Trump changed course. ""I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately,"" Trump posted onTruth Social.""Thank you for your attention to this matter!""
He made an exception for China, raising its tariff to 125%.

Tariffs are a tax on imported goods that businesses pay. Their cost is often passed on to consumers through higher prices.
The Trump administration has said that by raising revenue through tariffs, other federal taxes could be cut. But economists havesaidit’s unlikely high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans.
On the morning of April 7,X accountsamplified a significant exaggeration of a noncommittal response from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett responding to the possibility of a 90-day tariff pause. CNBC anchors repeated the unconfirmed information and later aired a correction.
Trump on April 7shared a clipof Fox News host Maria Bartiromo saying earlier that morning, ""Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening. ... President Trump is not going to bend.""
The White House held Trump’s line; its""Rapid Response 47"" X accountsaidreports that Trump was expected to issue a 90-day pause were ""fake news."" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitttold CNBCthe same thing.
During an April 8 White Housepress briefing, a reporter asked Leavitt if Trump was considering holding off on imposing some tariffs or reversing them due to negotiations with other countries.
""The president was asked and answered this yesterday,"" Leavitt said. ""He said he is not considering an extension or delay. I spoke to him before this briefing, that was not his mindset. He expects that these tariffs are going to go into effect.""
TheU.S. stock markethad tumultuous days and losses amid Trump’s announced tariffs.
Trump’s Truth Socialannouncementabout a pause for most tariffs came shortly after 1 p.m. ET on April 9. He said more than 75 countries had called federal officials to negotiate a solution and had not retaliated, except for China.
A few hours later at an event with auto racers, a reporter asked Trump to explain his thinking. Trump said: ""Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.""
Responding to another question about the pause, Trump said, ""I think in financial markets, because they change. Look how much it changed today. We went from, you know, pretty moderate today, but over the last few days, it looked pretty glum to, I guess they say it was the biggest day in financial history.""
Even after the 9.5% increase in theS&P 500market index on April 9, the metric was still down nearly 11% since its peak under Trump on Feb. 19, wiping away all gains since early September 2024, under both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden.
A reporter noted how Trump went from no pause to a pause in two days.
Trump said: ""You have to have flexibility. I could say, here’s a wall and I’m gonna go through that wall. I’m gonna go through it no matter what. Keep going and you can’t go through the wall. Sometimes you have to be able to go under the wall, around the wall, or over the wall. These guys know that better than anybody, right? You got to go around them sometimes, you’re not gonna go through them.""
Trump said he was thinking about a pause ""over the last few days"" as he was talking with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. ""I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning, just wrote it up,"" Trump said.
On April 7, a reporter asked Trump if he would be open to a pause to his country-by-country tariffs to allow for negotiation, and he replied, ""Well, we're not looking at that."" The White House said that social posts suggesting that Trump was considering a 90-day pause were ""fake news.""
But two days later Trump authorized a 90-day pause on the country-by-country tariffs. He said this decision came after several nations told the administration that they were willing to negotiate.
When asked by a reporter about the pause, Trump said people were ""jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy.""

Sen. Ruben Gallego is mostly right: American men trail women in higher education at historic levels,Claire Cranford,"April 9, 2025","Arizona Democrat Sen. Ruben Gallego said his political party needs to work harder to appeal to men, given how male votershelped propelPresident Donald Trump to his 2024 victory.
""A lot of Democrats don’t even try talking to men,"" Gallego said on the March 24 ""Raging Moderates""podcastepisode. ""We don’t talk about the fact that they have the lowest college attainment rate ever, that they are living at home with their parents, they are not having success.""
Data shows Gallego — whostood outamong 2024’s campaigning Democrats in part because he madeappealing to mena central part of his messaging — is largely accurate on male college attainment levels.
Education experts use the term ""college attainment"" to describe different things — in some cases, it refers to college completion rates; in others, it refers to any college experience. Gallego didn’t specify in the podcast what he was describing, but his spokesperson told us later he was referring to the share of male population on campus. Gallego’s overall point that men are attending postsecondary educational institutions at lower rates than womenhas beenwidelyreportedby think tanks and news outlets.
According to theNational Center for Education Statistics, four men were enrolled in postsecondary institutions for every six women in 2023, a historic low. This shift is a reversal of historical norms. The first U.S. woman to obtain a degree, Catherine Benson,graduated in 1840. Before then, higher education in the United States was reserved exclusively for men. Women have comprised more than 50% of college enrollmentsince 1979and the proportion of women in higher education has only grown.
Overall male enrollment numbers have increased since data was first collectedin 1869because of general population growth and larger numbers of degree-granting institutions. But thepercentage of degreesconferred on men hasshrunk at every degree level, per the National Center for Education Statistics.
The most recent data from 2020 graduates shows that, for women, thefour-year degree completion rateis 53.7%. For men, it’s 43.4%.
Richard Reeves, director of theAmerican Institute for Boys and Menand author of 2022’s ""Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It,"" said two main factors drive the college completion gap.
One reason is that they're less likely to enroll than women, and the other is that they are less likely than women to complete a degree within four years, he said.
The disparity is more pronounced for Black and Latino men, who are more than 10 percentage points less likely than white and Asian males toattend orcompletecollege, according to the American Council on Education.
Since 2008, male college enrollment has hovered around 8.4 million in the U.S.per academic year, while female enrollment has steadily increased. In 2022, 57% of male high school graduatesenrolledin college, compared with 66% of their female peers. That 57% is the same as in 1964.
""The gender gap in college is reflecting the gaps that have been accumulating all the way through the K-12 system, as opposed to causing them,"" Reeves said. ""It's not like girls and boys come out of high school equally prepared for college, and then something happens. The girls come out significantly ahead of the boys, especially on things like GPA.""
Fewer men think college is beneficial to their post-high school careers, and fewer men want to continue school when they are already lagging their female peers in K-12, Reeves said. Campus-specific surveys show that men increasingly report feeling alienated on college campuses, he said. ""They'll very often say that they'll find that the male students are the ones who just don't quite feel it ‘fits,’"" Reeves said.
Our ruling
Gallego said men now ""have the lowest college attainment rate ever.""
Gallego’s spokesperson told us he was referring to the share of college students who are men.
Although male enrollment raw numbers are higher today than they were in 1869 because of general population growth, National Center for Education Statistics data shows that men have fallen behind women in higher education enrollment and degree completion. National Center for Education Statistics data shows four men were enrolled in postsecondary institutions for every six women in 2023, a historic low.
Data from 2020 graduates shows that for women, the four-year degree completion rate is 53.7%, and for men, it’s 43.4%.

On April 7, the White House had dismissed rumors of Trump considering a 90-day pause as ""fake news.""
White House officials never publicly mentioned a 90-day pause of President Donald Trump's tariffs on April 7, but X posts falsely saying they did contributed to a briefmulti-trillion dollarstock market rally.
Verified X accounts that cover markets attributed reports of the supposed pause to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who had appeared on Fox News that morning. The posts — the first of which was shared at 10:11 a.m. — shared a significantly exaggerated version of Hassett’s response to an interview question about a 90-day pause. That incorrect information was echoed in web headlines and cable outlets that cover the markets.
One larger X account said its post was based on a news headline from an outlet it did not identify. It’s stillunclearwhere that purported headline originated; the markets started climbing at 10:09 a.m., shortly before the first X posts shared the 90-day tariff pause claim.
The rumored tariff reliefboosted the marketafter days of dips since Trump announced across-the-board tariffs on trade partners April 2.
Here’s how the rumor spread before the Trump White House addressed it.
At about 8:30 a.m. E.T., ""Fox & Friends"" host Brian KilmeadeaskedHassett whether the administration would consider a 90-day pause on tariffs.
""Yeah, you know, I think the president is going to decide what the president’s going to decide,"" Hassett said. ""There are more than 50 countries in negotiation with the president. We’ve got the prime minister of Israel coming today. We’ve had a reach out overnight from Taiwan. But I would urge everyone — especially (Bill Ackman) — to ease off the rhetoric a little bit."" (Ackman, a billionaire who endorsed Trump,saidthe president’s policies might trigger a ""self-induced economic nuclear winter."")
The distortion of Hassett’s remarks appeared to start with the X account Hammer Capital at 10:11 a.m.
""Hassett: Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China,"" the accountpostedin all capital letters. Then, in lowercase text: ""Mother of all squeezes incoming.""
Hammer Capital had nearly 700 followers April 7, and the account’s blue check mark shows that its owner is an X Premium subscriber.

The anonymous account, with 850,000 followers, primarily postsBloomberg Terminalheadlinesabout the markets. Although it isn’t affiliated with Bloomberg News, TechCrunchreportedit has been considered a reliable source of business news.
A 10:14 a.m.articleon ForexLive, a market news and analysis website, warned that the viral headline’s source was unclear even though the headline was being shared ""everywhere.""
Around the same time, CNBC anchors attempted to explain a sudden market rally.
""Apparently, Hassett’s been saying that Trump will consider a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except for China,""saidCNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla.
Jeremy Siegel, a frequent CNBC guest and Wharton School professor emeritus of finance, said: ""Oh, well that’s huge. I mean that changes the game.""
""We’ll try and source that exactly in terms of where that’s coming from,"" CNBC host David Faber said. A few moments later, a CNBC chyron repeated the claim circulating on X. After those initial mentions, CNBC reporters discussing the reported headline repeatedly said that the White House had not confirmed the news.
A CNBC spokesperson said later that as the network reported the market news in real-time, it had aired unconfirmed information in a graphic. Within about 20 minutes of its original report, CNBC’s senior Washington correspondent Eamon Javers made an on-air correction.
Next, Reuters ran a story crediting CNBC. The newswire later withdrew the story, according to anarchived version of the link.
""Reuters, drawing from a headline on CNBC, published a story on April 7 saying White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had said that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China,"" the storysaid. ""The White House denied the report. Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error.""
At 10:33 a.m., CNBC’s Javersreportedthat White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told him the 90-day pause chatter was ""fake news.""

For the media, the incident revealed reporting difficulties when facing ""a highly volatile stock market,"" said Jane Kirtley, a University of Minnesota professor of media ethics and law. She said the ""missing piece"" for news organizations was getting a response from the White House before publishing the original stories.
""The White House may not have been immediately forthcoming, but ultimately, news organizations should do everything possible to confirm a rumor — especially one with the implications this one had,"" she said.
X posts say Hassett said, ""Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except China.""
The posts appear to have been amplifying a distortion of a noncommittal response Hassett gave on ""Fox & Friends"" to a question about the possibility of a 90-day tariff pause. We found no credible reports that the Trump administration was ever considering a 90-day tariff pause.

Real Raw News, the site that published the headline, regularlyposts false information. Its ""About Us""pagealso notes that the website ""contains humor, parody and satire.""
This particular post baselessly casts doubt on Crawford’s win, saying she ""seemingly defeated Trump-endorsed Brad Schimel;"" the post also wrongly describes the 2020 election as ""stolen.""
Schimel, meanwhile, quickly conceded the election — andurged his supportersto accept the election results.

Fabricated image of Pope Francis greeting a purported Church of Satan priest spreads online,Ciara O'Rourke,"April 4, 2025","An image of what looks like Pope Francis grinning and gripping the hand of someone wearing a pale mask, clad in a red cloak, is circulating on social media with a caption that lacks context.
""Pope Francis, shaking the hand of the priest of the Church of Satan... ‘God does not reject anyone,’"" a March 30 Facebookpostsaid.

Francis hassaid""God does not reject anyone,"" but this isn’t an authentic photo.
A reverse-image search turned up no credible sources sharing the image.
As Snopesreportedin 2023, Récord, a Mexican sports newspaper,includedthe image in a roundup of the best images of the pope created by artificial intelligence.
We looked for but found no evidence, such as news stories, of a meeting between the pope and the Church of Satan purportedly illustrated in this image.
The Church of Satan didn’t immediately respond to PolitiFact’s questions about the post, but its websitenotesthat ""Satanists are atheists,"" not Devil-worshippers. Peter Gilmore is the organization’s high priest, and Peggy Nadramia is its high priestess,according to the site.

Elon Musk didn’t target Trump’s golf trips in an X post about DOGE,Ciara O'Rourke,"April 4, 2025","Since his first term, President Donald Trump’s golf trips have drawn criticism from detractors. And a recent HuffPost analysis found that taxpayers have so far footed a bill of more than $26 million for such outings in his second term.
But billionaire and White House adviser Elon Musk didn’t suggest on X that the Department of Government Efficiency had inadvertently identified Trump as the source of fiscal waste.
""Unbelievable,"" reads what looks like a March 16 screenshot of a Musk post. ""The DOGE team has discovered TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS spent on GOLF by a SINGLE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. Stay tuned for when we figure out who it is.""
Facebook postssharing this image were flagged as part of Meta’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about ourpartnership with Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads.)
Musk didn’t post this on X.
Itdoesn’t appear in his X feed, and we found no credible news reports indicating he posted and deleted such an announcement.
The image shared on Facebook also doesn’t reflect what the X website looks like today. For example, it appears as though Musk had ""94 Retweets"" at the time the screenshot was taken. But ""retweets"" ceased to exist after Musk acquired Twitter and renamed the social media platform X.
The purported post echoes a March 9 Guardianheadline: ""US taxpayers have shelled out tens of millions of dollars for Trump’s golf trips.""
But claims this is an authentic Musk post are wrong. We rate them False.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/apr/04/viral-image/elon-musk-didnt-target-trumps-golf-trips-in-an-x-p/
